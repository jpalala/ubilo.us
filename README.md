=======

existing online  link / bookmark seems to be focused on the user, sharing links with others or at least making these links summarized up seems to be a second priority. furthermore, it is polluted with non-programming related and purely opinion articles.

here at ubilous we make link discovery less painful. we intend to be community of link  archivists who make sure our link database is complete and fact-based. 

*Philosophy of other bookmark managers:*

Bookmark it away, read it later.. for study later.. No need to share, just a way to organize your bookmarks or in case of a crash, you have somewhere to look for your favorites.

*Philosophy of our bookmark manager:*

There has to be a reason why you saved that bookmark. Tell us why. 

The main reason is to share it with others. To enhance the sharing, you want to describe what the bookmark is about.This description should be short and concise enough to make a user decide whether or not s/he should read it.
